# MATLAB-solar-project
My First job, mathematically model solar power production and optimize it using AI
This code was run using MATLAB R2020a
Keep in mind a few things are missing, you will need to install PVlib and import those functions.
Also the code will simply not function because you require a custom input excel file, containing tracker coordinates, in the correct order
This repository is to simply demonstrate my coding capabilities, nothing more. I tire of coding exams for every position I apply to
